summary: "Automated car maintenance updates using WhatsApp and ChatGPT, but couldn't make the sale"
---

My brother in law owns a car maintenance company.
His problem was that he had to interact with the drivers of those cars to get the kilometers updates to know when 
to perform maintenance. It was a slow and laborious job, so I decided to automate the process for him.

Pictures at the end.

## The first idea

Initially, the idea was to build a website where drivers could update the Km. 
My brother-in-law would send them a link to access the site, where they would find a form to update it.

## Implemeting new ways

The initial tests worked, but it was clear that it was a suboptimal solution. 
I decided to pivot and not use a web interface for the drivers, only for my brother-in-law. 
The idea evolved into using the web as a dashboard to visualize the cars, 
where tasks could be marked as completed with the click of a button.

### WhatsApp Integration

I wanted to make it easy for both the client and the drivers, as everyone uses WhatsApp for communication. 
So, I opted to use a JavaScript library called "whatsapp-web-js" to establish the connection quickly and easily. 
Although WhatsApp has an official API, it is very difficult to access and use. The library option, while not entirely legal, 
was a viable choice given the time and budget constraints (which, ultimately, were quite followed).

### ChatGPT Handles the Conversation

With the WhatsApp integration almost complete, I could send a predefined message, and the client only had 
to wait for the driver to respond. 
However, this was unlikely, and inspired by some colleagues, I decided to implement a solution using AI to simulate 
a person having the conversation. 
One concern was the cost, but I realized that using the ChatGPT API was very affordable, especially 
with the option to choose less complex and more economical models.

#### ChatGPT Executes Code

A very powerful feature I found is that it is possible to train the AI to execute functions in your code very simply. 
I used it to determine, based on the context of the conversation, when the driver had responded with the current kilometers of the car. 
Once I had this, the AI would execute a function to validate and update the car in the database, interpreting not only the functions to execute but also the correct parameters. 
For example, if the driver responded with "200k," ChatGPT interpreted that value as 200.000.

This is undoubtedly a very powerful feature that I would have liked to use much more in the project.

### The Boring Part: The Frontend

For the admin web interface, I decided to use React, utilizing Google's MUI library package and particularly DataGrid for displaying tables and Toolpad for the dropdown menu. 
While it was interesting to find these libraries and configure them to perform complex tasks, this part was the least innovative.

I deployed the frontend using Vercel, which was a quick and easy option. 
However, it required setting up an HTTPS connection with the backend, which led to additional steps such as purchasing 
a domain. Although it was not what I initially expected, 
it turned out to be an interesting and valuable learning experience.

### The Stressful Part: The Backend

#### Railway: Good While It Lasted

Initially, I used Railway to deploy Docker containers. I liked it a lot because it saved me from having to configure an instance as a server and the CI/CD. 
The problem was that they apparently have the connection of the WhatsApp library I used blocked. After many attempts to connect to WhatsApp servers without success, 
I gave up using it and opted for a more conventional option.

#### AWS: My Old Friend

I tried to avoid using an EC2 instance on AWS because I wanted to use services that would take responsibilities off my hands. 
However, in the end, it was the best and fastest option. 
I used docker-compose to bring up the containers for the backend, database, and nginx. 
I chose not to use microservices as I wanted to do it as quickly as possible. 
   The technologies I used were:
      - JavaScript as the language
      - Node.js as the framework
      - Jest for testing
      - PostgreSQL for the database
      - Nginx for the reverse proxy and configuring HTTPS certificates
      - Docker and docker-compose for orchestration
      - GitHub Actions for continuous deployment.

### Conclusions

In the end, the product was very well received by the client; it was exactly what he needed. However, the solution was over-engineered, 
so we couldn't agree on a price. Considering the maintenance it would require, the cost-benefit ratio was ultimately not sufficient.

The application was a success; I learned a lot about technologies, but what I still need to learn more about is business. 
Undoubtedly, these are very powerful tools to create solutions quickly and relatively simply.
