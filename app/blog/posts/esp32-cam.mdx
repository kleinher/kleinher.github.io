Here's how I got my ESP32 camera working. It took some time and research to navigate through all the hacks and quirks, but it was worth it.

## Which One Did I Buy?

[Here’s the one I bought](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005002808966055.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.101.37e3194dLM5yUd&gatewayAdapt=glo2esp) in case you’re interested in getting the same model.

> *Note*: If it’s not available when you read this, most generic ESP32 camera modules should work. However, newer models might introduce different nuances. Good luck!

## Good Things to Know Before You Start

- **Camera Module**: There are a lot of options out there, but I recommend sticking with a basic module (like the OV2640 with a 66° lens) to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Capacitor**: I used a 2200uF 16V capacitor to improve stability and performance. It’s optional but may help prevent image lag.

## Setting Up the Connections
### Option 1: Using a USB Programmer

Using a USB programmer, you can plug the camera directly into your laptop. It should work for most basic testing.

### Option 2: Using an External Power Supply

Because the ESP32 camera modules are sometimes sensitive to power fluctuations, you may experience issues with a standard USB connection due to current spikes. I tried two configurations with a capacitor connected in parallel to the power supply, and here are the results:

#### 3V Power Supply
Connecting directly to the 3.3V and GND pins on the ESP32 worked, but I noticed a slightly slower image display.

#### 5V Power Supply
Connecting directly to the 5V and GND pins worked better, resulting in faster image processing.

#### 5V with Capacitor
This setup gave the best results with higher speed and better image quality.
